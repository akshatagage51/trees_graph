In this folder dijikstra's algorithm is implemented.
It is also called Single source shortest path.

Here source vertex is given to us & we have to find the smallest path 
from these vertex to every other vertex.

This algorithm works both on directed and undirected graph as long as
weight is non negative no.

The include folder consist of the header file.
source folder consist of library.
test folder consist of main file.

To run the program just do 
make
and then run the executable 
./main
