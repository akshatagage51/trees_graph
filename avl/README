This folder has the avl tree implementation

The include folder has header file for avl.h
The source folder consist of library for avl 
and the test folder has main file

Here while inserting a new node we have to make sure our propert of avl tree 
does not voilate.
Property of avl tree is the difference between the height of left subtree and right subtree 
should not be greater than 1.

If this property voilates we have to make left and right rotations based on the problem.

Library consist two main functions 
1. insert
2. delete_node

To run the program just do 
make
and then run the executable 
./main
