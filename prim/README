This folder consist of implementation of prims algorithm.

Primâ€™s Algorithm is an approach to determine minimum cost spanning tree. 
In this case, we start with single edge of graph and we add edges to it 
and finally we get minimum cost tree. 

The include folder consist of the header file.
source folder consist of library.
test folder consist of main file.

To run the program just do 
make
and then run the executable 
./main
