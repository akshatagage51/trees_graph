This folder consist of kruskals algorithm
This algorithm is used to find minimal spanning tree of a graph.

Steps to find MST using kruskals algorithm
1.Remove all loops.
2.Remove all parallel edges.
3.Select the minimum edge.
4.If all the vertices are covered then stop there.

The include folder consist of the header file.
source folder consist of library.
test folder consist of main file.

In this program I am creating a graph with cost associated with each vertices 
Then I am finding the minimal spanning tree.

To run the program just do 
make
and then run the executable 
./main
