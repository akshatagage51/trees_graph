This repository consist of programs realted to Trees and Graphs

In trees, The Binary search tree, AVL tree and the Red Black tree is implemented
And in graphs, basic creation of graph with adjacency list has been implemented.
To find a minimal spanning tree two greedy algorithms are implemented.

Kruskals algorithm is implemented by adjacency list
and
Prims algorithm is implemented by adjacency matrix.

Dijikstras algorithm is also implemented which is used to find the shortest path in a graph.
