This repository consist of programs related to Trees and Graphs

Trees implemented are:
    1.The Binary search tree
    2.AVL tree 
    3.Red Black tree 

Graphs implemeted are:
    1.Basic insertion of graph with adjacency list.

Spaning tree is implemented by two greedy algorithms
    1.Kruskals algorithm by adjacency list
    2.Prims algorithm by adjacency matrix.

Dijikstras algorithm is also implemented which is used to find the shortest path in a graph.
